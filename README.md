# Notes
## A quick rundown on ES6 classes and other helpful ES6 things

* ES6 classes provide a simpler and clearer syntax to create objects and deal with inheritance.
* Classes can be expressions and declarations, much like functions.
* You can have named and unnamed class declarations.
* Class declarations are not hoisted, and are executed in strict mode.
* Constructors can use the super keyword to use the constructors of a parent class.
* You can only have one constructor method per class.
